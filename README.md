## Hi there 👋

My name is Anastasia, an aspiring software developer from Florida! I'm currently in school with the goal to obtain an AS degree in Computer Programming and Analysis and potentially a Bachelor's in Information Technology afterwards. While I like the idea of combining these degrees with my degree in Biomedical Sciences, I'm finding out more  about the world of software development and what all I can create and do that keeps me from wanting to limit myself to one field.

Currently, I'm teaching myself Javascript and React as those aren't included in the A.S or B.S degrees that are offered.

Right now, I'm working on a couple of projects including a personal portfolio, a mockup therapy website, and a cursor controlled animation!

To reach me, my email is: anastasia.m.johnson20@gmail.com



Fun facts:
1. I'm a licensed paramedic
2. I've never been on a plane
3. I have 130+ books in my personal home library
